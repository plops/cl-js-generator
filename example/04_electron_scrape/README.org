  - webviews may not be working in future versions of electron
  - also i don't want to expose my node api to the scraped website (currently, i'm not sure if the webview is sufficiently isolated)
  - probably it is better to switch to client windows and ipc
#+begin_example
mkdir app
cd app
npm init
# -- answer a bunch of questions
npm install electron --save
# -- add start script to package.json
# npm start
#+end_example
